### leetcode_problems
My solved problems from leetcode. 
Actually, at some point it became more efficient to solve problems directly on the site leetcode.com directly, so here is only some of the solved problems.


#### Repository structure
- `problems/` - module with solved problems. Each submodule (name notation: `problem_name`_`problem_number.py`, lowercase) consists of README and solution.py
- `tests/` - some of tasks have tests written (name notation: `test`\_`problem_name`_`problem_number.py`, lowercase) for solved problems. Powered by pytest.
